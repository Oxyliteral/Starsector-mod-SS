# Starsector-mod-SS

Requires LunaLib.


Adds a custom ship to the game. It can be modified extensively using OP.

Weapon mounts cannot be added or removed through code. Hence, these ships have unprecedented amounts of weapon mounts, but using them costs an extreme amount of OP. Though, OP itself cannot be modified through code, so I had to create hullmods for each weapon mount and auto-add them if you use a weapon mount. Plans are to add a ship for each potential type (freighter, destroyer, cruiser, capital), and allow you to adjust logistics (crew, fuel, supplies) and flux (capacity/dissipation).
